I have installed the voice-app at to phones, at a OnePlus-7T and at a Pixel-4a. 
At the Oneplus it works perfectly, at the Pixel it doesn't:
I can't choose a audiobook directory. The phome doesn't react, when I choose 'Directory' or 'file'.
The OS an launcher at both phones are the same, Lineage 20.0 and Lawnchair. The app version (8.1.3) is the same at goth devices.
